# Hi, Iâ€™m Mick Cecil,
 I am a seasoned Security Engineer & Penetration Tester with a passion for offensive security, vulnerability research, and building resilient security programs. With over 15 years in information security and extensive experience in penetration testing, threat operations, and incident response, I specialize in breaking systems to make them stronger.

My journey in security has taken me through leading security engineering teams, designing and executing large-scale penetration tests, and driving strategic security initiatives at Amazon and other organizations. I thrive on discovering security flaws, developing exploit techniques, and working with teams to secure applications, networks, and cloud environments.

Beyond security testing, I have a deep background in security automation, incident response, and insider threat detection, and I hold multiple certifications and patents in the field. Iâ€™ve also competed in and won capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, including the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge, where I applied advanced offensive security techniques to real-world security problems.

This site serves as my digital space to share my projects, resume, and research. Whether itâ€™s offensive security, hardware hacking, exploit development, or security automation, I enjoy diving into technical challenges that push security boundaries.

ðŸ’¡ Current Focus:
ðŸ”¹ Penetration Testing & Red Teaming
ðŸ”¹ Web & Application Security
ðŸ”¹ Reverse Engineering & Exploit Development
ðŸ”¹ Hardware Security & Embedded Systems
ðŸ”¹ Security Research & Threat Hunting

If you're interested in collaborating, discussing security topics, or just geeking out over offensive security and breaking things (ethically, of course!), feel free to connect with me!

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s build and break security together!
