# Hi, Iâ€™m Mick,
 I am an experienced Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, and SecOps Leader with a passion for offensive security, vulnerability research, and building resilient security programs. With over 15 years in information security and extensive experience in penetration testing, threat operations, and incident response, I specialize in breaking systems to make them stronger.

My journey in security has taken me through leading security engineering teams, designing and executing large-scale penetration tests, and driving strategic security initiatives for Amazon's retail security team. I also have technical security and leadership experience in healthcare and hospitatlity markets. I thrive on discovering security flaws, developing exploit techniques, and working with teams to secure applications, networks, and cloud environments.

Beyond security testing, I have a  background in security automation, incident response, and insider threat detection, and I hold multiple certifications and patents in the field. Iâ€™ve also competed in and won large capture-the-flag (CTF) competitions, including winning the most creative, technical category in the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge, where I applied advanced offensive security techniques to real-world security problems.

This site serves as my digital space to share my projects, resume, and research. Whether itâ€™s offensive security, hardware hacking, exploit development, or security automation, I enjoy diving into technical challenges that push security boundaries.
