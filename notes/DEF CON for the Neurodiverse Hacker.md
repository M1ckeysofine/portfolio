# Navigating DEF CON as a Neurodivergent Attendee: Culture, Consent, and Change

## Introduction

My first DEF CON was DC24—the year of the Skull badge.

That badge, designed by LosT Boy (aka 1o57), didn’t just impress me—it *rewired* me. The intricacy. The hidden layers. The elegance of a puzzle that didn’t just reward knowledge but demanded curiosity. That year, I was hooked—not just on the challenge, but on the idea that DEF CON was a place where people like me could belong.

I'm neurodivergent. I wasn’t diagnosed until later in life, but looking back, it made perfect sense. Like many on the spectrum, I thrive in logic, patterns, and systems. Social nuance? Not so much. So when I stepped into DEF CON’s chaotic brilliance—equal parts conference, carnival, and command line—I felt both amazed and overwhelmed.

Over the years, I’ve come to realize that DEF CON operates on **two overlapping sets of rules**: one explicit (badges, talks, contests), and one hidden (social norms, cultural expectations). For neurotypical folks, those hidden rules might come naturally. For people like me, they’re often a moving target—and getting them wrong can have real consequences.

This article is my attempt to decode those unspoken expectations. To help new and veteran attendees on the spectrum navigate DEF CON as it evolves—from raw hacker rebellion to a globally influential security conference trying to build a more inclusive future.

## 1. The Two Cultures of DEF CON

There’s no single “DEF CON.” What you experience depends on where you go, who you’re with, and what you’re looking for. But broadly, I’ve noticed **two cultural operating systems** that run in parallel:

### 🔧 DEF CON Legacy Mode: The Classic Hacker Vibe

DEF CON has always been a paradox: part underground hacker gathering, part chaotic social experiment. In its early years, it was a place where you could see someone soldering a badge in one room while another person was getting roasted on stage in Hacker Jeopardy. The culture was raw, irreverent, and often intentionally provocative.

To understand this era, I highly recommend watching [**DEFCON: The Documentary**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ctQOmjQyYg). Filmed during DEF CON 20 in 2012, it captures the spirit of the conference's first two decades. The film offers a behind-the-scenes look at the event, showcasing its unique blend of technical brilliance, anarchic energy, and the unfiltered personalities that defined its early years.

### 🛡️ DEF CON Safe Mode: The Modern Cultural Shift

In the last decade, DEF CON has undergone a quiet but meaningful transformation. What used to be a mostly unstructured gathering of hackers is now a **global security conference with accountability structures**, formal policies, and an expanding mission of inclusion.

- New villages and spaces have emerged as intentional safe havens, including:
  - **Chill Rooms**
  - **HDA – Hackers with Disabilities and Access Needs**

These spaces don’t dilute DEF CON’s edge. They deepen it—by making sure **more kinds of minds and bodies can participate fully**.

## 2. Understanding “Acceptable” vs. “Harmful”

One of the hardest things to grasp—especially for neurodivergent folks—is **where the line is** between what's edgy but acceptable… and what's hurtful, exclusionary, or unsafe.

DEF CON has long walked this line. But in recent years, the community has started to draw **clearer boundaries**. The key difference now isn’t just *what* is said or done—it’s about **context**, **consent**, and **impact**.

### ✅ Acceptable: Edgy With Consent and Shared Context

- A friend calling you out during Hacker Jeopardy because you *volunteered* and know what you’re in for.
- Satirical talks that mock vendor security failures.
- DEF CON puzzles that push boundaries without humiliation.

But this kind of consent is only valid **as long as it’s mutual and ongoing**.  
> **Even implied consent can be revoked**—and when it is, the boundary needs to be respected.

### 🚫 Harmful: Behavior Without Consent, or With Power Imbalance

- Sexualized or demeaning comments without opt-in
- Public shaming over knowledge gaps
- Retaliation against feedback or complaints

### 🧠 Why This Is Especially Hard for Neurodivergent Attendees

- **Literal interpretation** of jokes or sarcasm
- **Delayed pattern recognition** in group dynamics
- **Masking and mimicry** that accidentally crosses lines
- **Sensory and cognitive overload** during the event

```plaintext
Legacy DEF CON: if (you_can_take_a_joke) { you_belong(); }
Modern DEF CON: if (everyone_has_opted_in && no_harm_is_done) { you_belong(); }
```

## 3. The Hadnagy Case: When Boundaries Aren’t Just Crossed—They’re Ignored

Christopher Hadnagy, formerly of the Social Engineering Village, was banned from DEF CON following multiple misconduct complaints. His defamation lawsuit against DEF CON was dismissed in 2025 after a judge ruled that the statements made were not defamatory because they were true.

### 🔄 Why This Wasn’t Just “Hackers Being Hackers”

Hacker culture pushes boundaries, but it also values consent, autonomy, and mutual respect. This case broke with that ethos:

- **No consent**: behavior in professional settings without opt-in
- **Power imbalance**: retaliation and influence over others’ opportunities
- **Community standards ignored**: complaints over years, with no resolution

## 4. Strategies for Neurodivergent Attendees

### 🎯 Build Your Script Before You Land

- Prepare opt-out phrases
- Schedule hotel breaks
- Use Villages like HDA or Mental Health as calmer base camps

### 🎮 Recognize the Social Minigames

- “Opt-in” is your safety net
- Feedback ≠ failure
- “The only winning move is not to play” — and that’s okay

### 🎧 Anchor in Hacker Culture That *Welcomes* You

- **Captain Crunch** and phone phreaking
- **Nerdcore artists** who wrote our soundtracks
- “Hack the Planet!” as a call for accessibility

### 🛠 Build a Personal Toolkit

| Need               | Hack                                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Social fatigue     | Earbuds, stim toys                                           |
| Sensory overload   | Sunglasses, deep pressure gear                               |
| Conversation opt-out | “Talk to me later” badges, prewritten scripts             |
| Real-time help     | **Ask a Goon—they’re here to help without judgment.**        |

### 🧑‍🚒 Goons: The Unsung Heroes of DEF CON

Goons (in red shirts) are volunteers who *make DEF CON happen*. They’re kind, trained, and not just enforcers—they’re problem solvers and support systems.  
Newbie or overwhelmed? Say:  
> *“Hey, I’m not sure where to go or what I need. Can you help?”*  
And they will.

## Conclusion: DEF CON Belongs to All of Us

DEF CON isn’t about being socially polished or neurotypical.  
It’s about curiosity, courage, and hacking systems—including social ones.

### 🛠 Quick-Start Kit for ND Hackers
