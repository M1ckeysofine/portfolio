- **Web Application Tester** – Identifies security flaws in web applications.
- **Cloud Penetration Tester** – Tests security in cloud environments.
- **Exploit Developer** – Develops and tests new software exploits.
- **Vulnerability Researcher** – Discovers new vulnerabilities and their impacts.
- **Red Team Operator** – Simulates real-world attacks to test an organization’s defenses.
- **Physical Penetration Tester** – Assesses security of physical locations through social engineering and physical security testing.

## 2️⃣ Defend Roles (Defensive Security)
These roles are responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security threats.

- **Security Administrator** – Manages security measures across IT infrastructure.
- **Cyber Defense Analyst (SOC Analyst)** – Monitors and responds to network security alerts.
- **Malware Analyst** – Investigates malware behavior and mitigation strategies.
- **Digital Forensics Analyst** – Analyzes security incidents and recovers data.
- **Incident Responder** – Responds to and mitigates cybersecurity incidents.
- **Threat Hunter** – Proactively searches for security threats in an organization.
- **Blue Team Specialist** – Focuses on defensive measures to protect IT systems.
- **Reverse Engineer** – Dissects malware, exploits, and software to understand attack techniques.

## 3️⃣ Build Roles (Security by Design)
These roles focus on designing secure systems and integrating security from the start.

- **Enterprise Security Architect** – Designs security frameworks for organizations.
- **Cloud Architect** – Develops cloud security strategies.
- **Security Solution Architect** – Designs security solutions for applications.

## 📌 Choosing a Cybersecurity Career Path
Cybersecurity careers cater to different skill sets and interests:
- If you enjoy **breaking into systems**, consider **penetration testing or exploit development**.
- If you prefer **defending networks**, consider **SOC analysis or incident response**.
- If you're passionate about **building secure systems**, explore **DevSecOps, cloud security, or secure coding**.
- If you like **policy and compliance**, pursue **GRC, risk analysis, or auditing**.

Regardless of your path, **continuous learning** is crucial in cybersecurity. Certifications like **GPEN, GCIH, OSCP, CISSP, CEH, Security+, and CISM** can boost your career.
