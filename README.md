Iâ€™m a Security Engineer, Penetration Tester, and SecOps Leader with a passion for offensive security, vulnerability research, and building resilient security programs. I am using 11ty to host my personal portfolio and random thoughts using this GitHub repo. Check out the results on https://mickcecil.com
